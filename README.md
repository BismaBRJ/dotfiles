There's not much to see here!

This repo just contains some of my configuration files such as for neovim, zsh, etc.

If it may interest you: so far, I intend to use neovim with somewhat-minimal configuration. I do hope my `nvim` folder won't grow too large or complicated. I just need some personal settings as in `init.lua`, and `lazy.nvim` so that I can use `vimtex`.
