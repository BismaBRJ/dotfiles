There's not much to see here!

This repo just contains some of my configuration files such as for neovim, zsh, etc.

If it may interest you: so far, I intend to use neovim with somewhat-minimal configuration. I do hope my `init.lua` file won't grow too large, or if I ever end up splitting it or somehow making the nvim folder more modular, I hope to not have too much going on in there.
